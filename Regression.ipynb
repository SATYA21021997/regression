Here are several strategies to address and improve your model in the presence of high multicollinearity:\n",

        "Use Case: When the categorical variable has a natural order (e.g., Low, Medium, High).\n",

        "Example: For \"Color\" {Red, Blue, Green}, you use two columns (e.g., Red and Blue), and Green is implied when both are 0.\n",

        "4. Frequency Encoding:\n",
        "Categories are replaced with their frequency of occurrence in the dataset.\n",

        "Use Case: When the frequency of a category carries meaningful information.\n",

        "Replace categories with the mean value of the dependent variable for each category.\n",

        "Example: If \"Color\" affects house prices, you calculate the average price for each color and use it as the encoding.\n",

        "Use Case: Useful when there is a relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Binary Encoding:\n",
        "Categories are first converted to integers, then transformed into binary, and each bit is used as a separate column.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: For \"Color\" {Red = 1, Blue = 2, Green = 3}, binary representations (01, 10, 11) are used as features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Case: Effective for variables with many categories, reducing dimensionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Ordinal Encoding:\n",
        "Assigns a numeric value based on the natural order of the categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: For \"Education Level\" {High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD}, encode as {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n",

        "Polynomial regression is a powerful tool for modeling non-linear relationships, but it comes with several limitations and challenges. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Overfitting:\n",
        "Higher-degree polynomial models are prone to overfitting, especially with small datasets. The model may fit the training data too well, capturing noise and irrelevant fluctuations rather than the underlying pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "This reduces the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Extrapolation Issues:\n",
        "Polynomial regression can produce unrealistic predictions when applied outside the range of the observed data. For instance, higher-degree polynomials may exhibit extreme fluctuations at the edges of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Interpretability:\n",
        "As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model becomes more complex and harder to interpret. Understanding the individual contributions of higher-order terms can be challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Risk of Multicollinearity:\n",

        "…\n",
        ") are added to the model, they can be highly correlated with one another. This can lead to inflated standard errors and unstable coefficient estimates.\n",

        "Polynomial regression is sensitive to outliers, as these can significantly influence the shape of the curve, especially for higher-degree polynomials.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Computational Complexity:\n",
        "With higher degrees or multivariate polynomial regression, the number of terms increases rapidly. This can make computations more resource-intensive and may lead to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Degree Selection:\n",
        "Choosing the appropriate degree of the polynomial is crucial. A degree that is too low may underfit the data (failing to capture important trends), while a degree that is too high may overfit it.\n",
